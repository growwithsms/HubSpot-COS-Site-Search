# DEPRECATED: HubSpot has released an official search API. I definitely recommend using the official API for a proper HubSpot site search instead of this.

# HubSpot COS Modal Site Search
The missing HubSpot COS Site Search Module, inspired by HubSpot.com's search functionality.

## Features
* Drop in solution
* Automatically loads search results from your sitemap

## Getting Started
* Add cos-site-search.css and cos-site-search.js to your site.
* Activate by linking to the id "cos-search" like so:
```html 
<a href="#cos-search">Search</a>
```

## Dependencies
* jQuery 1.7+
* HubSpot COS website
* List.js (packaged in the js file)
